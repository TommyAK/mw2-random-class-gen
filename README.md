# mw2-random-class-gen

This is a small program I developed in Python that will generate a random MW2 class. 

Note: This program assumes that you are level 70 and have everything unlocked.

## Features
* Generates a random class in seconds!
* Takes into consideration Bling and One Man Army.

## Example
```
Primary: F2000 [ Grenade Launcher ]
Secondary: SPAS-12 [ Silencer ]
Perk 1: Marathon
Perk 2: Danger Close
Perk 3: Steady Aim
Death Streak: Martyrdom
Equipment: Semtex
Special Grenade: Smoke Grenade
```

## To Do
* Support for custom items found in third-party clients (e.g. IW4x).
* Clean up and simplify the code.
* Improve output readability.
* Killstreak support
